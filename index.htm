        Hello everyone! Been a while since I last posted an update, I was a bit
        impatient with my 2021 post so it came a bit too early, mostly because I
        was very excited to talk about the PSX port project. This time I waited
        properly for my 21st birthday :D. You know, this idea of writing a
        yearly diary has been helpful, there were times at which I would
        randomly remember it and write down some thoughts that I found to be
        important, or worth mentioning. It strangely keeps me "grounded", I
        guess. It's currently 1:12AM and raining, so I thought I'd put a fitting
        background :D It's constantly been very sunny recently, today being the
        exception with a gloomy, white sky for the entire day, which is ironic,
        since I'm probably one of the only 3 people on planet earth to make a
        comment about the weather not as some form of a filler/icebreaker, but
        as a genuine comment, since a clear (clouds are fine as long as they're
        not gray and don't have a rainy vibe to them), blue, sunny sky makes me feel very
        nice.
        <br>
        <br>
        The past year has been pretty cool in terms of programming project
        related stuff - zerno, elliot and I got to work on reverse-engineering
        the bootleg game, which is something that Buns requested way back when I
        first made lainland. I got to write a decently-sized project in C for
        the first time, which was very pleasant. It's one of those languages for
        me where the way you do things makes sense - the general paradigm and
        architecture of a project written in it. There were a couple of things
        that I didn't particularly enjoy about it, header files being a good
        example, but still. It's also the first language where I had to deal
        with UB, some of the bugs I saw would have probably taken me weeks to
        figure out on my own without the help of Valgrind (absolute godsend of a
        program). Overall it was a great learning experience.
        <br><br>
        Aside from that, I also got to write some other minor
        projects/scripts/etc in other languages, biggest one being in Java.
        <br><br>
        Currently, I'm rewriting the codebase for the PSX port, it's been a
        funny and humbling experience, it's filled with things and decisions
        that do not make any sense to me, to the point where I'm surprised I was
        even able to complete the project, even though it's only been a year or
        so since I wrote it. It makes me think whether I'll look back on my
        current work in another year and feel the same way about it, and if so,
        how long this will last D:
        <br><br>
        I have also switched to using Vim (specifically Neovim) as opposed to
        VSCode (web stuff)/Emacs (for everything else), except for Lisp-related
        things, I think Emacs is clearly superior in that regard. VSCode was
        VERY clunky for larger projects for some reason, the Vim emulation was
        not great, frequently buggy and in general slower. I've found that those
        minor inconveniences add up to cause stress fairly quickly. Of course,
        for Java/Kotlin and such I still use JetBrains software, which I don't 
        have any issues with, it's great.
        <br><br>
        This year I also shut down lainland. I don't think I'll go into the
        reasoning behind it here, since I've already made an announcement on the
        server. I am very proud of how it turned out to be overall, it was a
        pleasure working on different projects, playing SuperTuxKart and hanging
        out in voice chat. It also served as a central "hub" for international
        lain-related stuff for the majority of its existence. I do have some
        regrets, feeling like I wasn't good enough to keep it in proper shape,
        but I hope that someone who's better than me at maintaining a community
        will create an even larger, more successful one in the future :D
        <br><br>
        I have also quit smoking! I don't even remember how long it's been but
        I'd assume it to be around 4-5 months by now. It's been fairly
        difficult, I still get nostalgic sometimes about having a cigarette,
        especially at times like these when it's chill and silent. BUT! I'm on
        the no-smoke grindset and I don't plan on stopping, that habit has
        caused me way more harm than good, even though I was fortunately young
        enough to not notice any negative effects directly impacting my health.
        <br><br>
        Other than that, life has been pretty colorless. Days just seem to melt
        together, lacking of short-term things to look forward to, which is the
        exact opposite of how I felt a couple years ago, it's not how I had
        imagined life to be like at this age. Feeling this way is probably one
        of the main reasons I enjoyed watching "The Tatami Galaxy" so much, if
        you haven't seen it, I suggest giving it a shot. The sequel for it is
        coming out in a couple of months, the image for this post is the "cover"
        art for it, I hope it will be at least nearly as good as the first one
        :D
        <br><br>
        I think that's about it for now! I will sit down sometime in the future
        and clean up this mess of a website because it is completely
        unmaintainable in its current form, even adding this post requires way
        more effort than it should.
